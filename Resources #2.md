# Resources #2

Pre Session 2 Resources: Complete by 10th Sep 2025

1. ETL Pipeline
- Airflow: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/index.html
- Dagster: https://docs.dagster.io/examples/etl-pipeline
- core data building and integration (optional, you can choose to explore so you are aware of production grade data ingestion): https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs

Streaming Data
- Fundamentals of Kafka: https://medium.com/inspiredbrilliance/kafka-basics-and-core-concepts-5fd7a68c3193
- Extended Fundamentals: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#gettingStarted
- Documentaion: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#implementation

Agentic Memory
- Basic Langchain Memory: https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_memory/
- Explore memory types:
    - Episodic
    - Semantic
    - Working
- Graphs, Architectures and Reflection: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop
Over all the entire langchain docs are a good exploration to have done as they provide great conceptual clarity as well as implementation support. You should ideally prefer reading this over ChatGPT recommendations or simply copying the generated code.

- mem0: https://docs.mem0.ai/introduction
This will form a central backbone when we need to develop memory layers in a pipeline moving forward.

## Assignment
Extend your present google suite agents with streaming, ETL and integrate mem0 for memory in the framework.

Deadline: 12th September
